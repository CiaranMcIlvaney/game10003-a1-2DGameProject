This is a 2d spooky Halloween frogger game where you must get past the ghosts that infiltrated the road, as well as jump on massive sized candy bars to avoid getting touched by the nasty witch potion juice that has covered the whole neighbourhood. You play as a black cat in this game that is trying to get back to the house safely. To play you use WASD to move around as the cat, you must avoid the ghosts and witchâ€™s potion juice. If you get hit by either you will lose and be forced to start over by pressing spacebar. If you can win you get a popup congratulating you on your win, with the option to press spacebar to play again. Play this game if you DARE!
